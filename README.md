CS106B - Solutions to Section Assignments
=========================================
Here are my solutions to the section assignments
in the course CS106B from 2008 given by Julie Zelenski and made available
through Stanford Engineering Everywhere.

Most of the solutions have been written in Visual Studio 2012 and some in
Qt Creator. I haven't used the given GUI classes but instead used QML and
the Qt framework.
